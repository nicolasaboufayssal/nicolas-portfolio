            <h2>CentraleSupélec – Specialised Master in Energy&nbsp;Market&nbsp;Management</h2>
            <p><em>2019–2020</em></p>
            <p>My specialised master at CentraleSupélec was a deep dive into the complexities of energy markets. The curriculum spanned the economics of electricity supply and demand, risk management and derivatives, market design and regulation. Working alongside classmates from across the globe, I built forecasting models and traded hypothetical megawatts on simulated markets, analysing how renewables integrate into existing grids and how price signals influence investment.</p>
            <p>The capstone project required us to simulate a regional power market from scratch: we designed generation portfolios, optimised dispatch schedules and proposed policies that balanced profit, reliability and sustainability. Throughout the year I honed my quantitative and communication skills—learning to present technical insights to policy makers and business leaders and to bridge the gap between engineering and economics.</p>

            <h2>ESIB – Electromechanical&nbsp;Engineering</h2>
            <p><em>2014–2019</em></p>
            <p>At the Ecole&nbsp;Supérieure&nbsp;des&nbsp;Ingénieurs&nbsp;de&nbsp;Beyrouth (ESIB) I spent five years immersed in electromechanical engineering. The programme blended theory with practice: I wired circuits, programmed microcontrollers and machined parts in the workshop. Courses in control theory, power electronics and software engineering broadened my perspective beyond pure mechanics and taught me how to connect hardware and software.</p>
            <p>Outside the classroom I joined the robotics club and co‑led a micro‑wind‑turbine project, designing and testing blades to maximise energy capture. For my thesis I researched electro‑mechanical storage systems, exploring how flywheels and batteries could smooth renewable generation. These experiences taught me to design, build and test complex systems under tight constraints and to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams.</p>

            <h2>Professional&nbsp;Certificates</h2>
            <p>I never stop learning. To broaden my technical and strategic toolkit I completed a series of online and in‑person courses. At the University of California, Davis I studied SQL for Data Science, mastering joins, window functions and query optimisation. A Coursera course from Postman introduced me to API fundamentals, while an elective at the University of California, Irvine taught me the fundamentals of corporate finance.</p>
            <p>To strengthen my leadership skills I followed a Strategic Management programme at Copenhagen Business School, examining case studies on competitive advantage and organisational design. And because I love building things, I attended a hands‑on satellite workshop at TU&nbsp;Berlin where we designed and launched a CanSat. Each certificate represents a chapter of curiosity—whether mastering data queries, understanding business models or engineering small satellites—and adds new tools to my toolkit.</p>
