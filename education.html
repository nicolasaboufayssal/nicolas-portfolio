            <h2>CentraleSupélec – Specialised Master in Energy&nbsp;Market&nbsp;Management</h2>
            <p><em>2019–2020</em></p>
            <p>My specialised master at CentraleSupélec was a deep dive into the complexities of energy markets. The curriculum spanned the economics of electricity supply and demand, risk management and derivatives, market design and regulation. Working alongside classmates from across the globe, I built forecasting models and traded hypothetical megawatts on simulated markets, analysing how renewables integrate into existing grids and how price signals influence investment.</p>
            <p>The capstone project required us to simulate a regional power market from scratch: we designed generation portfolios, optimised dispatch schedules and proposed policies that balanced profit, reliability and sustainability. Throughout the year I honed my quantitative and communication skills—learning to present technical insights to policy makers and business leaders and to bridge the gap between engineering and economics.</p>

      <h2>École Supérieure des Ingénieurs de Beyrouth (ESIB) – Electromechanical Engineering</h2>
      <p><em>Bachelor of Engineering</em></p>
      <p>After earning my baccalaureate with distinction, I joined ESIB in Beirut to explore my passion for mechanics and electronics. The electromechanical curriculum immersed me in control theory, circuit design and structural mechanics while emphasising practical lab work. During my final year I built a 3D‑printed robotic arm controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, which reinforced my understanding of embedded systems. This hands‑on foundation prepared me for the quantitative rigour of my later Master’s work at CentraleSupélec and nurtured my curiosity for applied engineering.</p>

            <h2>Professional&nbsp;Certificates</h2>
            <p>I never stop learning. To broaden my technical and strategic toolkit I completed a series of online and in‑person courses. At the University of California, Davis I studied SQL for Data Science, mastering joins, window functions and query optimisation. A Coursera course from Postman introduced me to API fundamentals, while an elective at the University of California, Irvine taught me the fundamentals of corporate finance.</p>
            <p>To strengthen my leadership skills I followed a Strategic Management programme at Copenhagen Business School, examining case studies on competitive advantage and organisational design. And because I love building things, I attended a hands‑on satellite workshop at TU&nbsp;Berlin where we designed and launched a CanSat. Each certificate represents a chapter of curiosity—whether mastering data queries, understanding business models or engineering small satellites—and adds new tools to my toolkit.</p>
